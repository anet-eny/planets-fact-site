# Planets Fact Site

An interactive web application displaying facts and information about the planets in our solar system, built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project is a solution to the Planet fact site challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f).

## Features

- **Dynamic Planet Selection**  
  Navigate between 8 planets through a responsive header menu.

- **Tabbed Content Display**  
  Switch between _Overview_, _Internal Structure_, and _Surface Geology_ views for each planet.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewport.

## Key Learnings

- **React State Management**  
  Managing multiple state variables (`selectedPlanet`, `activeTab`).

- **Component Architecture**  
  Breaking down a complex UI into reusable components  
  (`Header`, `Menu`, `PlanetImage`, `PlanetInfo`, `TabButtons`, `Stats`).

- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**  
  Creating complex responsive layouts using CSS Grid with custom column templates and Flexbox for component-level layouts.

- **React Hooks**  
  Using `useState`, `useEffect`, and creating custom hooks like `useMediaQuery` for responsive behavior.

- **Data Transformation**  
  Converting JSON array data into a keyed object structure for efficient lookups.

- **CSS Custom Properties**  
  Using CSS variables for dynamic styling and maintaining consistency across components.

- **Import / Export Patterns**  
  Organizing constants, utilities, and assets for maintainable code structure.

- **Responsive Images**  
  Managing different image sizes across breakpoints using `clamp()` and `max-width`.

- **Array Methods**  
  Using `map()`, `reduce()`, and `Object.keys()` for data manipulation and rendering.
